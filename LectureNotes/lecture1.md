# Lecture 1 Introduction, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions

## Outline

Two halves

1. Computability Theory: What is computable... or not?
2. Complexity THeory: What is computable in practice?

## Finite Automata

- States
- Transitions
- Start state
- Accept states

## Regular Language

### Definition

A language is called a regular language if some finite automaton recognizes it.

### Operation & Regular Expression

- Union
- Concatenation
- Star

Use the regular operations to build up expressions describing languages, which are called regular expressions.

Regular Expression and finite automata is equivalent
