# Lecture3 Regular Pumping Lemma, Conversion of FA to Regular Expressions

## Finite Automata --> Regular Expression

### GNFA

GNFA > NFA > DFA

DFA, NFA, GNFA, and Regular Expression are all equivalent

## Non-Regular Languages

- To show a language is regular, we give a DFS.
- To show a language is not regular, we must give a proof. ==> Pumping Lemma ==> combine closure properties with the pumping lemma

## Context Free Grammars

Grammar is constituted by rules

Rule: Variable -> string of variables and terminals
Variables: Symbols appearing on left-hand side of rule
Terminals: Symbols appearing only on right-hand side
Start Variable: Top left symbol

L(G) is the language of all generated string
